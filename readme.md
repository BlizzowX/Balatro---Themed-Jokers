# Theme 1:(8/8) **Combat Aces**!<br>
Jokers for this theme all synergize well with playing aces<br>

# Theme 2:(7/13 Done) **Cosmic**!<br>
Cosmics collect Tokens on their jokers to boost them<br>
They also always retrigger certain ranks of cards each.<br>

# Theme 3:(6/6) **The Mischievous One**!<br>
Based around the Pieces of the Mischievous One<br>
The Jokers get a boost for each other and can get strong if you get them early<br>
