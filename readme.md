Themed Jokers by Blizzow

Adds different jokers to the game that hopefully synergize together.

Jokerpack 1 includes:
Combat Aces - Jokers centered around ACES.

Combat Ace - Soldier:
Scored Aces add 35 chips.

Combat Ace - Promotion:
Played Aces have a 1 in 6 chance to become a random Edition

Combat Ace - General:
"Combat Ace Jokers" each give x1.5 Mult. Also counts itself

Combat Ace - Recruiter
Discarded cards have a 1 in 8 chance to become an Ace

Combat Ace - Mercenary:
Scored Aces add x1.5 Mult. You have to pay $5 at the end of each round, or this Joker is destroyed

Combat Ace - Veteran:
Scored Aces repeat and add 50 chips. Adds +10 Chips to that effect at the end of each round.
This is a legendary, but I added an alternative way to get this joker.
